âœ… Case Study 2: Social Media Posts
Case:
A social media platform stores posts in a posts collection. A sample document looks like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "user_id": "u123",
  "content": "Loving MongoDB!",
  "likes": 34,
  "comments": [
    {"user": "u234", "text": "Me too!", "timestamp": ISODate("2024-09-01T09:30:00Z")},
    {"user": "u235", "text": "Same here!", "timestamp": ISODate("2024-09-01T10:00:00Z")}
  ],
  "tags": ["mongodb", "nosql"],
  "created_at": ISODate("2024-09-01T09:00:00Z")
}
Questions:

How would you retrieve posts that have the tag "nosql" but not "mongodb"?

Write a query to return only the number of likes for each post (omit all other fields).

Suppose you need to display the number of comments per post. What aggregation pipeline would you use?

How would you ensure that only the latest 5 comments are retained in the document?
