Study 1: E-Commerce Product Catalog
Case:
An online store uses MongoDB to manage its product catalog. Each product document includes fields like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "name": "Wireless Mouse",
  "category": "Electronics",
  "price": 699,
  "stock": 120,
  "ratings": [4, 5, 5, 3, 4],
  "tags": ["computer", "accessory", "wireless"],
  "created_at": ISODate("2024-08-10T10:00:00Z")
}
Questions:

Which data type is best suited for the ratings field, and why?

Write a query to find all products in the Electronics category with a stock less than 50.

How would you update all products tagged as "wireless" to also include the tag "bluetooth"?

What MongoDB operator can you use to calculate the average rating of each product?

If you want to automatically delete documents older than 1 year from the created_at field, what MongoDB feature would you use?
